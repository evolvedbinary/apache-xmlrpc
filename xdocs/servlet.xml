<!--

The XML-RPC library can be embedded into any Web server framework that supports 
reading HTTP POSTs from an InputStream. The typical code for processing an 
incoming XML-RPC request looks like this:

<small><tt>&nbsp;XmlRpcServer xmlrpc = new XmlRpcServer ();</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;xmlrpc.addHandler ("examples", new ExampleHandler ());</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;...</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;byte[] result = xmlrpc.execute (request.getInputStream ());</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;response.setContentType ("text/xml");</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;response.setContentLength (result.length ());</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;OutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;out.write (result);</tt>
<tt>&nbsp;out.flush ();</tt></small>

Note that the <tt>execute</tt> method does not throw any exception, since all 
errors are encoded into the XML result that will be sent back to the client. 
A full example servlet is included in the package.

There is a sample XML-RPC Servlet included in the library. You can use it as a 
starting point for your own needs.
