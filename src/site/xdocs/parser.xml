      <p>
      Apache XML-RPC supports
<a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/SAX1">SAX 1.0</a>
and can therefore be used with any compliant XML parser. The default parser
is John Wilson's <a href="http://www.wilson.co.uk/xml/minml.htm">MinML</a> parser
which is included in the package so you don't need anything else to start using
the software. MinML is an ideal parser for XML-RPC because it is small, fast,
and implements exactly the features of XML which are used by XML-RPC.
      </p>
      <p>
If you want to use a different SAX parser, you can do this by calling the
setDriver() method in org.apache.xmlrpc.XmlRpc with the class name of the
SAX parser.
      </p>
<pre>  XmlRpc.setDriver ("your.sax.driver");</pre>
       <p>
Alternatively you can set the parser by setting the System property
"sax.driver" to the class name of the parser you want to use.
       </p>
<pre>  java -Dsax.driver=your.sax.driver helma.xmlrpc.WebServer</pre>
