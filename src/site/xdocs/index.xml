    <section name="About Apache XML-RPC">
      <p>Apache XML-RPC is a Java implementation of <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>,
      a popular protocol that uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure calls.

      </p>
      <p>
      Apache XML-RPC was previously known as Helma XML-RPC. If you have code using the
      Helma library, all you should have to do is change the import
      statements in your code from helma.xmlrpc.* to org.apache.xmlrpc.*.
