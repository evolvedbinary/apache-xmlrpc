      <question>What is the state of the streaming branch?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Quite different from what you possibly want to hear: It
          is not even alpha software.</p>
        <p>It is a proposal, developed by <em>one developer</em> of
          the Apache XML-RPC community. It has absolutely no formal
          acceptance by the developer community. It isn't reviewed.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the proposal is to recieve the communities
          feedback. If the community refuses the streaming branch,
          then it will possibly never even see a formal alpha release.
          We'll have to see.</p>

      <question>How do I enable request compression?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>That's simple: Set the properties "enabledForExtensions"
          and "gzipCompressing". That said, note the following
          hints:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting these properties will only work, if the XML-RPC
            server is aware of request compression. Compression is a
            violation of the XML-RPC specification, so typically the
            server will refuse the request, unless it is an Apache
            XML-RPC server with version 2 or later. (Apache XML-RPC 2
            supports request compression, although it was officially
            designed to be strictly compliant to the XML-RPC specification.
            However, noone was aware, that compression violates the
            specification. :-)</li>
          <li>Compressing the request doesn't mean that the response
            will also be compressed. You need to request response
            compression to achieve that.</li>
        </ul>
      </answer>

    <faq id="compression_response">
      <question>How do I enable response compression?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>That's as simple as enabling request compression: Set the
          properties "enabledForExtensions" and "gzipRequesting".
          That said, note the following hints:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting gzip compression is a standard HTTP feature.
            In other words, you may safely request compression from
            any XML-RPC server, even if it doesn't run Apache XML-RPC.
            </li>
          <li>However, requesting compression doesn't necessarily mean,
            that the response *is* compressed. It depends on the server.</li>
        </ul>

  <part id="server">
    <faq id="streaming_mode">
      <question>How do I enable streaming mode?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Set the property "enabledForExtensions". Note, that enabling
          the streaming mode doesn't mean, that all responses are served
          in streaming mode. It depends on the clients:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a client sends a content-length header, then the server
            assumes, that the client is a traditional XML-RPC application
            and doesn't support the vendor extensions from Apache XML-RPC.
            Consequently, the server assumes, that it needs to set the
            content-length header itself and disables the streaming mode
            for that particular request.</li>
          <li>However, if the client doesn't send a content-length header,
            then the server assumes that it will be able to accept any
            standard HTTP/1.1 request and enable the streaming mode.
            Streaming mode means, in particular, that the response will
            not contain a content-length header.</li>
        </ul>
